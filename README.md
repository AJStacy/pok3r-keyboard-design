# Andrew Stacy's Custom Vortex RGB Pok3r Key Design

In the repo is an Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file that I custom designed for my
Vortex RGB Pok3r 61-key mechanical keyboard.

+ My keyboard design takes some inspiration from the Apple keyboard in how it lays out symbols.
+ It takes inspiration from the original RGB Pok3r keys for symbols representing keys such as Return and Shift.
+ I incorporated icons from my favorite game, Minecraft, for fun.
+ I have Caps Lock swapped with the bottom right FN key to make utilizing the built-in Pok3r arrow key functionality easier to use.
+ I put a dot to allow light through in case I would like to return to using the key as a Caps Lock.
+ The key with the padlock symbol is where the Caps Lock was moved.
+ The lightning bolt is the symbol I chose for configuring the Pok3r's built-in programming.
+ The space bar was an idea I adapted from the original Pok3r spacebar. Instead of dots I thought bars would look cool.
+ The "H" key has a house icon representing the **Home** key when holding FN. It also has arrows representing my key shortcut for entering Vim Mode.
+ I used the Helvetica font because it's clean and readable compared the the font used by the original Pok3r keys.

I printed the design with [MaxKeyboard.com](http://www.maxkeyboard.com).
